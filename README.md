This project is about creating a landing page using mainly HTML, CSS and some Javascript code to make some functions work correctly. 
This website originated from W3schools.com, and I used it as a model to learn how to code and modify the elements to look the same as the original webpage.
During the process of building this webpage, I had a chance to apply the knowledge about basic front-end programming languages (HTML,CSS and Javascript) to a practical product, understand more about how to do things logically and carefully to avoid wasting lots of time finding and fixing bugs.
